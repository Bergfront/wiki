So here we gonna learn ways of installing GearLock in your desired android-x86 system. There are several ways of doing so, you just need to pay some attention and read everything properly to avoid errors.

### Get the latest GearLock installer binary

Simply head over to [this](https://supreme-gamers.com/r/gearlock-custom-recovery-replacement-for-android-x86.40) link and click on **Download** button.

### Place the binary anywhere inside android filesystem

In this guide we will copy `gearlock` installer-binary to either **Main Storage** or **Internal Storage** or **/sdcard** from a file manager.

I'm using [FX File Explorer](https://fx-file-explorer.en.uptodown.com/android) for moving `gearlock` installer-binary to **Main Storage** (aka the **Internal Storage**) from my **Downloads** folder.

### Switch to command terminal / console

Now press either `Alt + F1` or `fn + Alt + F1` for switching to a command terminal.

If the buttons are not working as suggested above then install [Termoneplus](https://apkpure.com/termone-plus-terminal-emulator/com.termoneplus) terminal emulator and open it.

### Run the installer binary

Once you're in a black terminal prompt, type in the following and press **Enter** key after each line.

```bash
su
cp /sdcard/gearlock /data
cd /data
chmod 777 gearlock
./gearlock
```

### Select your operating-system partition in the installer

So, at this stage you should have the installer-binary running. I have my android-x86 operating system installed inside the 7th partition called **Android**. Enter the partition number of your android-x86 installation.

# Updating

You will get notified in GearLock when there is a new update available.

You will be able to update directly from `GearLock > metro > more > Updater`

You can also follow the same instructions of **Installing GearLock** as described in the beginning of this page to perform a update over an existing version and the old version will be overwritten.
